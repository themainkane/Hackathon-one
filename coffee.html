          We work with speciality coffee from current crops which is carefully
          roasted. Our coffee is fruity, juicy and never boring. We bring you
          the best from leading european specialty roasteries, currently mostly
          from <a href="#">Square Mile Coffee Roasters</a>, a multi award
          winning coffee roasting company based in East London.

            Fruity redcurrant and sweet honeysuckle flavors. An incredibly juicy
            coffee which we struggled to decide on the right berry descriptor,
            but raspberry, blackberry and blueberry were also in the running!
